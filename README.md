# Intro to GitHub

## Why use Github?

- Github allows you to work on branches
- Github allows you to save work remotely
- It is good for working collabortively
- You should not normally do any development or make any changes from the dev branch. It is for pulling and merging
- The best thing to do is to link the dev to main branch, checkout to dev then checkout to a new feature branch
- Once you have finished or merged that feature, checkout back to dev
